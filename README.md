# hacks_for_the_computationally_inclined

Just some quality-of-life improving hacks that I've come across.

## **Disclaimers:**

- Mike takes no responsibility for anything that breaks your workflow,
and won't feel bad about any of these that are embarrassing or bad habits ðŸ™ƒ
- These are almost entirely clipped from stackexchange or elsewhere over
the course of years, so my profound apologies if an uncredited author
runs across them
